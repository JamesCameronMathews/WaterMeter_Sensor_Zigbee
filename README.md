# ðŸ’§ WaterMeter_Sensor_Zigbee

A **solar-powered ESP32-C6-based sensor** that monitors pulses on the **Itron TD8 water meter** and transmits data via Zigbee.

## Project Overview

I have an **Itron TD8 water meter** at home in Australia, which features a spinning metal diskthat completes one rotation per 0.01 mÂ³ of water consumption. Inspired by similar DIY projects using inductive proximity sensors, I wanted a self-contained, solar-powered, and Zigbee-compatible solutionâ€”rather than relying on wired Wi-Fi setups. So I built this using the **DFRobot FireBeetle ESP32-C6** platform.

## Software Implementation

- Developed using **Arduino IDE** with **Espressif Zigbee** and **PCNT (Pulse Counter)** libraries.
- The sensor is registered as a simple analog Zigbee sensor.
- Reports:
  - **Pulse count** (water usage)
  - **Battery percentage**
- **Sleep logic** is not fully implemented yet, as it interferes with PCNT functionality.

## Home Assistant Integration

Once paired via Zigbee, the sensor appears as a battery-powered analog device. You can use the pulse count to calculate water usage and set up automations or alerts in Home Assistant.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

- Implement deep sleep logic without disrupting PCNT.
- Add enclosure temperature/humidity/air pressure monitoring (hardware already in place.
- Optimize solar charging and battery management.
